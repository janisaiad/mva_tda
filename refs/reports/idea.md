- the contributino mainly comes towars tackling the diagonal point, and this is important (seen in experiments with W2 on the graph page 8 that sucks)
- lemma 2 is strong
- a line of math research for them is to try to get same approx rate with more realistic assumption than lower bound of EPD  density
- the algorithm is online so new data coming through (like change of regime) is tackled well
- there is 2 theorem : the EPD converge and its quantized counterpart also !! in fact this is not a TDA paper but more a computationnal geometry paper in general
- a very good TDA contribution could be to link those theorems in practice with 1 tda workflow (with the code i got)




so there is 3 things to do :
- implement a TDA workflow that utilizes the algorithm to solve a particular problem
- trying to get better assumptions that can lead to convergence and see what are the practical ones
- this is a minimax theorem : find the worst case and see empirical minimax bounds for in practice problems (network 2d random graphs that expand, time series also lol)
